# Mean and Median Imputation using Scikit-learn

-> This project demonstrates how to handle missing data using **Mean** and **Median** imputation techniques.  
-> We implement both methods with the help of **scikit-learn's SimpleImputer** and compare the effects on the data distribution.

## Key Steps:-
-> Identify missing values in the dataset  
-> Apply **Mean Imputation**  
-> Apply **Median Imputation**  
-> Compare results and check for **variance shift** after imputation  

## Libraries Used:-
-> pandas  
-> numpy  
-> scikit-learn  
-> matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## Objective:-
-> Understand the impact of different imputation strategies and maintain data integrity for machine learning models.
